Q. Is Homoeopathy a complete system of medicines? </font></b><font color="#111111">
<br><br>      A. Fundamentals of homoeopathic medicines embody in system of laws, doctrines and rules of practice, formulated and systematically set forth by Hahnemann over the years its proven efficiency is in day-to-day ailments and in comprehensive chronic diseases. Millions and millions people across the world use and rely on homoeopathic treatment. Homoeopathy be made available to more and more people for their health- benefits’ and is a definite help in most of diseases prevailing these days.
<br><br>      </font><b><font color="#FF6600">

<br><br> 
Q. Is Homoeopathy an efficient of all system of medicines?
<br></font></b><font color="#111111">
                    <br>       A. Homoeopathy is scientific system of medicine based on natural law of cure and proving is done on healthy human volunteers. We recognize and verify therapeutic efficiency by our clinical practices. We collect all those valuable data and up dates into our data bank. We practice by most modern medical knowledge and treatment is result orientated. 
<br><br>       </font><b><font color="#FF6600">
Q. How you say Homoeopathy is humane.<br><br> 
<br></font></b><font color="#111111">
                    <br>      A. Homoeopathy medicines work on the principle of harmonic resonance. It is sympathetic towards life force of a patient and is sympathy medicines this replicates principle of likes cures likes and relationship between actions of the remedy on healthy person, the proving and therapeutic actions on the sick are sympathetic. Humane face is reflected by proving, approach is humane & treatment is natural non-toxic, harmless and cure is from within, unlike antipathies’ superficial. 
<br><br>       </font><b><font color="#FF6600">
<br><br> Q.  What are its special doses? </font></b><font color="#111111">
<br><br>       A. Preparation of homoeopathic medicines is, by special method of potentisation of therapeutic valued active agents to extract their desired stimulation in subtle form for the sick. Moreover, potentisation increases the dynamic curative power of remedy and reduces its earthy matters. Law of small doses stimulation is in tone with homoeopathic concept and a future medicine, small doses act as curative while larger doses (contemporary drugs) destroy the healing process. Ultra-doses are harmless and cure through them is durable and long lasting.
<br><br>       </font><b><font color="#FF6600">
<br><br> Q. Why homoeopathy is so popular?
<br></font></b><font color="#111111">
                    <br>       We manage psychosomatic, psychological and personality disorders successfully by our health therapies. Mind is equally responsible for deranged body functions it may be primary or secondary triggering cause. Mind symptoms and changed behavior patterns are strong valuable pointers for us for treatment strategies. We emphasize more over them.  Different studies have shown a higher success rate in psychosomatic disorders like Asthma, Peptic ulcers, Ulcerative colitis, Irritable bowel syndrome, DM, Eczema, Psoriasis, and Arthritis etc. Psychosexual disorders or minor deviations, erection deficiency, premature ejaculation, dyspareunia etc In behavior pattern disorders homoeopathic medicines show higher therapeutic success rate and people treated are occupying jobs, consider themselves use full and have satisfactory social acceptance. 
<br><br>      </font><b><font color="#FF6600">
<br><br> Q. Do you have better substitute to anti-allergic, anti-virus, antibiotic and antifungal drug? </font>
</b><font color="#111111">
<br><br>      A. We provide better treatment through homoeopathic constitutional treatment and reduce patient’s sensitivity towards a virus, bacteria, allergen or fungus, and lessening the patient predispositions to certain diseases. Our treatment is better answer to infectious diseases like UTI, Sinusitis Tonsillitis, and Meningitis etc &their prevention. Superficial symptomatic treatment is of no help. Our treatment is deeper for deep underlying mechanism of a disease like viral meningitis, mumps, measles & chicken pox etc.  Homoeopathic treatment prevents their recurrence. Allergies may develop during life or be carried since birth. They need higher attenuations (dynamic homoeopathic medicines) say in Rhus-poisoning the  person takes ills and is cured by energy homoeopathic Rhus or a person is born with tenacious allergy and may persist unless until person gets individualized homoeopathic treatment for possible cure to remove the allergy disposition according to the make up of the person. Allergies like Allergic Rhinitis, Polyps, Urticarea, Contact dermatitis, Allergic Asthma, food allergy etc. For fungal infections all predisposing factors, local or systemic are controlled by homoeopathic treatment, local hygiene is necessary. Co-existing disease like DM are treated by constitutional homoeopathic specifics and is superior line of treatment.
<br><br>      </font><b><font color="#FF6600">
<br><br> Q. What is Homoeopathic individualization? </font></b><font color="#111111">
<br><br>      A. Genetic make up, vitality, mind, temperament, emotions, personality varies person to person. We consider every patient different from one another, likewise every homoeopathic medicine produces particular changes in the body, mind and emotions during proving and no other medicine produces similar changes so homoeopathic medicines are individualized. It is our domain.
<br><br>
<br>
<br>      </font><b><font color="#FF6600">
Q. Why Homoeopathic are preferred preventives? </font></b><font color="#111111">
<br><br>       A. Successful homoeopathic prevention occurs at many levels. As susceptibilities to many common diseases, are predisposing due to   genetic traits and other important factors. We recognize them, by increased incidence of a disease. These predispositions are treatable by our special constitutional treatment where disease symptoms and individual as a whole is treated and in build, defense mechanism is coordinated. Homoeopathic treatment works both ways curative as well as preventive. Such cures and preventions are resistant and long lasting.

<br>
<br>      </font><b><font color="#FF6600">
Q. Why Homoeopathic are better prophylaxes?
<br></font></b><font color="#111111">
                    <br>       A. Homoeopathic prophylaxes are best & of 3-Types, they are safer and effective. First - type is protection against infectious diseases, work by natural immunity development, provided by the continuous homoeopathic treatment like constitutional treatment.
<br><br>      Second - type is to create immunity against diseases like Diphtheria, Polio, Mumps, Measles, Whooping cough, Rubella, Influenza type-B, Chickenpox etc. the duration of treatment is very short, and immunity against disease is for a longer period without any side effects. 
<br><br>      Third - Type prophylaxis, is remedial measure against epidemic diseases. We call it epidemicus, which provide protection during break of epidemic-diseases. Either strong deep acting nosodes or proto type homoeopathic remedy especially selected, as during spread of Chickenpox, a nosodes is selected and few doses act as prophylactic.

<br>
<br>      </font><b><font color="#FF6600">
Q. Why Homoeopathy is a considered careful management? </font></b><font color="#111111">
<br><br>      A. Indiscriminate uses of immune suppressants (like conservative treatment) are also affecting the other organs causing systemic dysfunctions and multiple organs failure. Before hand, we must decide what is curable and what is incurable. During conservative treatment certain diseases like cancers, AIDS It is imagine that they are doing something with strong drug doses. Actually, situation worsens by the treatment. However, we use non-harming natural therapeutic measures to uplift the confidence, of the patient, immunity is increased, and vitalizing important organs to alleviate the sufferings with our subtle doses. We know a cure is abandoned but remarkable control is accomplished, there will be better life expectancy with bare minimum cost.

                    <br>      A. Surgery is a sound clinical practice in some life threatening diseases it is inevitable. However, there are number of surgical pronounced conditions where homoeopathy is helpful and averts surgeries as it is deep acting, cures & prevents chronic diseases such as Adenoiditis, Hypertrophied tonsillitis, urinary and gallbladder stones, BPH, Piles, Anal Fissure/ Fistula, Cyst, Urethral stricture, Mastoid ties, Tumors, Corns, Warts etc.

                    <br>      Every patient has every right to know the potential outcome of a treatment he/she is getting.
